# 📌 Polynomial Operations using Singly Linked List

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates polynomial operations using a singly linked list in C. The supported operations include:

✔️ **Polynomial Addition**
✔️ **Polynomial Subtraction**
✔️ **Polynomial Multiplication**

## 🛠 Features
- Efficient handling of polynomial expressions using linked lists.
- Dynamic memory allocation to accommodate polynomials of any length.
- Easy-to-use input and output functions for user interaction.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)

### Compilation & Execution
```sh
# Compile the program
gcc polynomial_operations.c -o polynomial_operations

# Run the executable
./polynomial_operations
```
